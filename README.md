## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze Fitbit fitness tracker data and provide insights that can help WeFit and its subsidiaries make informed marketing and business decisions. By understanding smart device usage trends and how customers can benefit from them, we aim to optimize marketing plans and identify potential customers who are likely to purchase personalized diet plans for weight loss.

## Business Task

The main objective of this project is to analyze Fitbit fitness tracker data and derive insights that can support marketing and business decisions. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Determine smart device usage trends and how customers can benefit from them.
2. Identify potential customers who are likely to purchase personalized diet plans for weight loss.
3. Optimize marketing plans based on the analysis of Fitbit fitness tracker data.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, which was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The data was collected from Fitbit users who consented to the submission of their personal tracker data.

## Methodology

To achieve the objectives mentioned above, the following steps were followed:

1. Data preprocessing: The Fitbit fitness tracker data was cleaned and prepared for analysis.
2. Smart device usage trends: The data was analyzed to identify patterns and trends in smart device usage.
3. Customer segmentation: Users were grouped into categories based on their activity levels and fitness goals.
4. Potential customer identification: Using criteria such as BMI, weight loss goals, and health conditions, potential customers for personalized diet plans were identified.
5. Marketing plan optimization: Insights from the analysis were used to optimize marketing plans and target the identified potential customers effectively.

## Results
